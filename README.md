This project scratches two itches. First, I wanted to know how much each of my prints cost in both time and filament, and second, I've been meaning to learn more about PyQt. Thus, this project was born.

This project is about 80% complete, where the major stuff like the GUI and calculations are functional, the last 20% will be things like custom configs for prices per kg and prices per hour.

Tested on Linux, but I assume Windows, Mac, and probably BSD will all run this without issues if PyQt6 is installed.
