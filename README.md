This project scratches two itches. First, I wanted to know how much each of my prints cost in both time and filament, and second, I've been meaning to learn more about PyQt. Thus, this project was born.

Tested on Linux and Windows but I assume other operating systems will all run this without issues if PyQt6 is installed.
